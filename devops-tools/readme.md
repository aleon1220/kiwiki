I have a KVM purchased by the company. I can plug in 4 laptops/computers at the same time.

the purpose of this page is to define the DevOps Principles and tooling to be used throughout my career. 

## Principles
1. Serve. Servant Leader
1. Listen first always. When speaking keep it short and concise
1. Never use you
1. dont take offence. people dont have the understanding you as a professional have gathered
1. Do your very best and God will do the rest
1. Sometimes you just have to say yes sir or yes madam
1. sometimes the culture will be very hesitant to change. Just accept that you can only change yourself and slowly impact the environment around you


## Tooling
At work they have provided a windows 11 laptop, my personal Linux ubuntu 2020 laptop, a toshiba laptop with windows 10 and there will be a somehow powerful Computer with GPU for video games and machine learning processing.
