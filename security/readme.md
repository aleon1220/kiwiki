## Security and chryptography

I was to generate some security keys to sign an android package!
Info i have found on my quest after using some openssl commands from [this guide](https://wladimir-tm4pda.github.io/porting/release_keys.html)

#### 2020-09-25 Security Task for Android
i was given a security task: Generate some security encryption keys to sign an android package!

Here is some info i have found on my quest after using some `openssl` commands from this guide [Android release keys](https://wladimir-tm4pda.github.io/porting/release_keys.html)

``` bash
#!/bin/bash

AUTH='/C=NZ/ST=Auckland/L=Locality 2/O=Android/OU=Android/CN=Android/emailAddress=user@email.com'
if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
        echo "Create a test certificate key."
        echo "Usage: $0 NAME"
        echo "Will generate NAME.pk8 and NAME.x509.pem"
        echo "  $AUTH"
        exit
fi
# 2048 initial. Upgraded to 4096. This will not work.
openssl genrsa -3 -out $1.pem 2048

openssl req -new -x509 -key $1.pem -out $1.x509.pem -days 10000 \
    -subj "$AUTH"

echo "Please enter the password for this key:"
openssl pkcs8 -in $1.pem -topk8 -outform DER -out $1.pk8 -passout stdin
```
## Concepts
### X.509 Certificate
In cryptography, X.509 is a standard defining the format of public key certificates.

**Certificate filename extensions**

There are several commonly used filename extensions for X.509 certificates. Unfortunately, some of these extensions are also used for other data such as private keys.

- `.pem` – (Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail) Base64 encoded DER certificate, enclosed between `"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----"` and `"-----END CERTIFICATE-----"`
- `.cer`, `.crt`, `.der` – usually in binary DER form, but Base64-encoded certificates are common too (see .pem above)
- `.p7b`, `.p7c` – `PKCS#7` SignedData structure without data, just certificate(s) or CRL(s)
- `.p12` – `PKCS#12`, may contain certificate(s) (public) and private keys (password protected)
- `.pfx` – `PFX`, predecessor of `PKCS#12` (usually contains data in PKCS#12 format, e.g., with PFX files generated in IIS)
PKCS#7 is a standard for signing or encrypting (officially called "enveloping") data. Since the certificate is needed to verify signed data, it is possible to include them in the SignedData structure. A .P7C file is a degenerated SignedData structure, without any data to sign.
- `PKCS#12` evolved from the personal information exchange `(PFX)` standard and is used to exchange public and private objects in a single file.

### Analyze and Check artifacts generated by `OpenSSL`
#### Check RSA Key
`openssl rsa -in My_KEY.pem -check`
#### Check certificate
`openssl x509 -in certificate.x509.pem -text -noout`
#### metadata of certificate and key
`openssl x509 -text -in CERTIFICATE.pem`

#### Convert a private from traditional to PKCS#5 v2.0 format using triple DES:
`openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -v2 des3 -out enckey.pem`

#### Convert a private key to PKCS#8 using a PKCS#5 1.5 compatible algorithm (DES):
`openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -out enckey.pem`

#### Convert a private key to PKCS#8 using a PKCS#12 compatible algorithm (3DES):
`openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -out enckey.pem -v1 PBE-SHA1-3DES`

#### Read a DER unencrypted PKCS#8 format private key:
`openssl pkcs8 -inform DER -nocrypt -in key.der -out key.pem`

#### Convert a private key from any PKCS#8 format to traditional format:
`openssl pkcs8 -in pk8.pem -out key.pem`

#### Obtain certificate from a domain and reate a `.pem`
```bash
DOMAIN="example.com"
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect $DOMAIN:443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM > NEW_CERT.pem
```

#### Add a set of certificates to a linux OS Key store
```bash
DOMAIN="example.com"
cp certificateDomain.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/cloudbuilder.crt && \
update-ca-certificates
```

The output will look something like
```bash
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...

Adding debian:certificate.pem
done.

```
### TLS validations
- #### Test SSL certificate of particular URL
`openssl s_client -connect yoururl.com:443 –showcerts`

### Check if SSL V2 or V3 is accepted on URL

#### To check SSL V2
`openssl s_client -connect secureurl.com:443 -ssl2`

#### To Check SSL V3

`openssl s_client -connect secureurl.com:443 –ssl3`

#### To Check TLS 1.0

`openssl s_client -connect secureurl.com:443 –tls1`

#### To Check TLS 1.1

`openssl s_client -connect secureurl.com:443 –tls1_1`


#### To Check TLS 1.2
`openssl s_client -connect secureurl.com:443 –tls1_2`

#### Verify if the particular cipher is accepted on URL
`openssl s_client -cipher 'ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA' -connect secureurl:443`

#### Convert from Private Key `.pk8 ` to `.PEM`
`openssl pkcs8 -in $PRIV_KEY_NAME.pk8 -inform DER -nocrypt -out $NEW_PRIV_KEY_UNENCRYPTED.pem`

### Java Key Store
#### From JKS --> .p12 --> .PEM
read the [blog](http://www.gnudeveloper.com/groups/cyber_security/Cryptography_RSA_Key_Exchange_works_in_realtime_using_Keytool_openSSL%20.html)

#### Generate JKS
``` bash
keytool -genkey -alias gdalias \
  -keystore www_gnudeveloper_com.jks \
  -keyalg RSA   -keysize 512 \
  -storepass gnudevpwd \
 
openssl pkcs12 -in www_gnudeveloper_com.p12  -out www_gnudeveloper_com.pem
```

#### Import JKS
``` bash
keytool -importkeystore \
  -srcstoretype JKS \
  -deststoretype PKCS12 \
  -srckeystore www_gnudeveloper_com.jks \
  -destkeystore www_gnudeveloper_com.p12 \
  -storepass gnudevpwd
```
#### Command to generate a `.keystore ` or ` .jks`
``` bash
echo y | keytool -genkeypair -dname "cn=Mark Jones, ou=JavaSoft, o=Sun, c=US" -alias business -keypass kpi135 -keystore /working/android.keystore -storepass ab987c -validity 20000
```
##### Flags explanation for command to generate KeyStores
<br>

- `dname=`is a unique identifier for the application in the .keystore. It includes
    - `cn=`the full name of the person or organization that generates the .keystore
    - `ou=`Organizational Unit that creates the project, its a subdivision of the Organization that creates it. Ex. android.google.com
    - `o=`Organization owner of the whole project. Its a higher scope than ou. Ex.: google.com
    - `c=`The country short code. Ex: For United States is "US"

- `alias=`Identifier of the app as an single entity inside the .keystore (it can have many)
keypass=Password for protecting that specific alias.
- `keystore=`Path where the .keystore file shall be created (the standard extension is actually .ks)
- `storepass=`Password for protecting the whole .keystore content.
- `validity=`Amount of days the app will be valid with this `.keystore`
#### Add a website certificate in `.pem` to the JKS
``` bash
keytool -import -alias marine.net.int -keystore ${JAVA_CERTS} -file PEM_FILE_Name.pem -storepass $ADD_PASS -noprompt
```

### Convert keys between GnuPG, OpenSsh and OpenSSL [website](http://sysmic.org/dotclear/index.php?post/2010/03/24/Convert-keys-betweens-GnuPG%2C-OpenSsh-and-OpenSSL)

### OpenSSH to OpenSSL
OpenSSH private keys are directly understable by OpenSSL. You can test for example:

```bash
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -text
openssl dsa -in ~/.ssh/id_dsa -text
```

#### You can also convert then to PEM format easily (notice, format for SSH private keys and PEM is very close):
``` bash
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out key_rsa.pem
openssl dsa -in ~/.ssh/id_dsa -out key_dsa.pem
```

So, you can directly use it to create a certification request:

`openssl req -new -key ~/.ssh/id_dsa -out myid.csr`

You can also use your ssh key to create a sef-signed certificate:

`openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in myid.csr -signkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out myid.crt`

> **Notice:** I have not found how to manipulate ssh public key with OpenSSL

### OpenSSL to OpenSSH
Private keys format is same between OpenSSL and OpenSSH. So you just a have to rename your OpenSSL key:
`cp myid.key id_rsa`

In OpenSSL, there is no specific file for public key 
(public keys are generally embeded in certificates). Extract public key from private key file:
`ssh-keygen -y -f  myid.key > id_rsa.pub`

### GnuPG to OpenSSH
You need to know fingerprint of your RSA key. You can use:
`gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format short`

use `openpgp2ssh` tool distributed in with monkeyshpere project:
`gpg --export-secret-keys 01234567 | openpgp2ssh 01234567 > id_rsa`

- A few notes are necessary:
01234567 must be fingerprint of a RSA key (or subkey)
`gpg --export-secret-keys` also accept finger print of global key (in this case, it exports all sub-keys). However, `openpgp2ssh` only accept finger print of an RSA key

If no arguments are provided, `openpgp2ssh` export RSA keys it find
You can now extract ssh public key using:
`ssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub`

### GnuPG to OpenSSL
We already saw all steps. Extract key as for ssh:

``` bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format short

gpg --export-secret-keys 01234567 | openpgp2ssh 01234567 > myid.ke
```

- Convert this key to PEM format:
`openssl rsa -in myid.key -out myid.pem`

- create a certification request:
`openssl req -new -key myid.key -out myid.csr`

- Create a sef-signed certificate:
`openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in myid.csr -signkey myid.key -out myid.crt`

### GnuPG S/MIME to OpenSSL

##### Gpgsm utility can exports keys and certificate in PCSC12:
``` bash
gpgsm -o  secret-gpg-key.p12 --export-secret-key-p12 0xXXXXXXXX
```

You have to extract Key and Certificates separatly:
``` bash
openssl pkcs12 -in secret-gpg-key.p12 -nocerts -out gpg-key.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in secret-gpg-key.p12 -nokeys -out gpg-certs.pem
```
You can now use it in OpenSSL.

You can also do similar thing with GnuPG public keys. There will be only certificates output.

### OpenSSL to GnuPG S/MIME
Invert process:

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -in gpg-certs.pem -inkey gpg-key.pem -out gpg-key.p12
gpgsm --import gpg-key.p12
GnuPG S/MIME to OpenSSH

# Now, chain processes:

gpgsm -o  secret-gpg-key.p12 --export-secret-key-p12 0xXXXXXXXX
openssl pkcs12 -in secret-gpg-key.p12 -nocerts -out gpg-key.pem
We need to protect key, else ssh refuse it.

chmod 600 gpg-key.pem
cp gpg-key.pem ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen -y -f gpg-key.pem > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# OpenSSH to GnuPG S/MIME
# First we need to create a certificate (self-signed) for our ssh key:

`openssl req -new -x509 -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ssh-cert.pem`
We can now import it in GnuPG
#### Format 12 compatible with java JKS
`openssl pkcs12 -export -in ssh-certs.pem -inkey ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ssh-key.p12`
#### import created key above
`gpgsm --import ssh-key.p12`

Notice you cannot import/export DSA ssh keys to/from GnuPG

```
