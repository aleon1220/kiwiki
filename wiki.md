# Wiki Information Technology
it happened in 2020-04-28. For years i have been collecting snippets on linux, solaris, C, Java, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
Then a google docs file was inside of a google drive folder. I accidentally deleted the folder and later on i emptied the bin. I truly dislike that. 
I got in touch with google support to no avail. 
I still hope i can recover my file.

Dont rely on the cloud 100%. Have local copies of your digital material.
