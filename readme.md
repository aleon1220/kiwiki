## Introduction
- **2019-11-10=** lost my google docs wiki file. I should have been more careful.
- **2020-04-28=** I lost years of work on an Information Technology Wiki. This markdown wiki has been started since 2020

Througout my career, 12+ years (2022) I have been collecting snippets on linux, solaris, C, Java, Docker, Kubernetes, windows and more

I used a `.txt` file, then a google docs file which was accidentally deleted from Google drive folder. After accidentally deleting the folder, I emptied the bin. There was no way to recover the file. I tried contacting google support to no avail
